#### Notes
* **Dashboards** - AWS expenses some charges at the beginning of a billing period, while other charges are incurred on a daily basis. To normalize for time-series and period-over-period analysis, we display everything aggregated at the monthly level (since all billing periods are monthly, aggregations at this level will include both periodic and daily cost items).
